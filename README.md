# Bing-API-Searchengine-PHP (last-modified 10/22 project-end 10/22)

## This search engine is an open-source project based on PHP and the Bing Search API. It is free to use and modify according to your needs. The codebase may require some adjustments and debugging to meet your specific requirements. We encourage contributions to improve its functionality and reliability.

I'm excited to share my custom-built search engine, designed with a complete user interface, auto-suggest functionality, and integration with the Bing API. This project is a comprehensive template for anyone interested in developing their own search engine technology.

Current Status:

Outdated Implementation: The current version of the search engine is functional but outdated, which may affect performance and modern compatibility.
Bug Fixes Needed: There are known bugs that require attention to improve stability and functionality.
Security Enhancements: The application lacks robust security measures. It is highly recommended that future development adheres to OWASP guidelines to significantly enhance security.
Project Overview:
This repository serves as a foundational tool and a thought support ("Denkst√ºtze") for developers looking to create or modify a search engine. It is an excellent starting point, but it requires updating and security optimizations to meet current standards.

I encourage developers, especially those with expertise in web security and search technologies, to contribute to evolving this project into a more secure and efficient platform. Let's collaborate to push the boundaries of what our search engines can achieve!
